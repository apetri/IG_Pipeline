Machine specific submission scripts
===================================

If you run on Blue Gene Q look in the BGQ directory, if you run on a machine that supports the SLURM job scheduler (such as the TACC Stampede for example), look in the SLURM directory, if you run on a machine that supports the PBS job scheduler (such as the Columbia Yeti cluster for example) look in the PBS directory.
