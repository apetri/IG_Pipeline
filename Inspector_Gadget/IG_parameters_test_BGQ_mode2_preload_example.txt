# Parameters for Inspector Gadget
# Can be changed arbitrarily after Gadget-2 run.
# Have nothing to do with Gadget-2 run itself, just with output processing.
# Keywords in arbitrary order, but care sensitive.
# No spaces within keywords allowed.
# Feedback will not start until feedback keyword is read,
# thus if you wish feedback for read-in of parameters, place this keyword first.

### Unusual parameters (typically not to be changed): ###
Species 1                  # 0: gas (SPH), 1: dark matter (halo). So far only 1 used and tested.
Scramble_mode 2            # 0: No box rotations or shifts, 1: simple random number (does not work well when code is run parallel), 2: random numbers from prefabricated list (up to 1000 realizations possible). Default is 2.
Plane_shift 1 # Shifts planes transversally (with periodic completion) before ray-tracing, causing additional randomization. Depreciated parameter, always set to 0.
Ray_tracing 1              # Ray-tracing is on if !=0. Default is 1 (on).
Cell_embedding 2     # Particles on Grid: 1: Cloud-in-cell, 2: TSC. Best is TSC.
Raypoint_averaging 3 # 1: for linear averaging, 2: for bicubic averaging, 3 (and everything else): for TSC averaging over derivative values on grid. 
Convergence_direct 0  # If !=0, calculate convergence directly from density planes (for testing mostly, default is 0 for this parameter).

### Unusual parameters (typically automatically set by code from sim): ###
Plane_padding 0 #0.05          # 0 is no padding, i.e. exact size visible by survey, 1.0 is size of survey (extra half on each side), etc. Alway leave this at zero.

### Frequently used parameters:

Mode 2 # 1: Potential Planes, 2: WL Maps
First_snapshot 0   # 0 
Last_snapshot 58    # 58 
First_realization 1  # 1
Last_realization 128 #  In Mode 1: Set to number of lens planes per snapshot (9); in Mode 2, set to number of maps (or foreground realizations per galaxy catalogue subfield), i.e. typically 1000.
Seed_block 9   #9      # 10 is a good value for 1GB memory / CPU on NYBlue/P (i.e. DUAL mode) and nx=2048, 3 for nx=4096 on NYBlue/P and DUAL mode (2 on NYBlue/L and CO mode). 8 for nx=4096 and SMP mode (NYBlue/P only). Use 9 for new minimal plane method (or as many planes as there are per snapshot.

Max_realizations 1000 # maximum number of realizations allowed during ray-tracing, before random numbers repeat between different subfields.
Preload_planes 1 # 0: read in potential planes as needed for each map (standard operation mode), 1: preload all potential planes at the beginning of the run (into an RMA window) - useful for Blue Gene/Q with NFS PB disk.
Number_of_plane_realizations 9 # This can be later automatized from random plane drawing file.
Number_of_sim_ics 5 # 5 # This can be later automatized from random plane drawing file.
First_sim_ic 1 # count starts at 1. First N-body simulation IC used.

Snapskip 1   # 1 # Set to 1 if not snapshots are to be skipped, otherwise to correspondingly higher numbers (2 for j-series of simulations, 1 for the more modern i-series and m-series).
Fiducial 0  # For Mode=2:  Submitted cosmologies beyond this number treated as nonfiducial models, cosmologies lower or equal to this number are fiducial (more ICs, fewer plane realizations per IC). Count starts at 1. Set to zero if all are nonfiducial. Leave this at zero. Control fiducial models by giving a a different random number file.
