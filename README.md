Inspector Gadget Pipeline (deprecated)
===============

The Inspector Gadget Pipeline has been deprecated; this repository contains the source codes for CAMB,N-GenIC, Gadget2 and the Amiga halo finder. The pipeline functionalities will be replaced by the new [LensTools](http://www.columbia.edu/~ap3020/LensTools/html) weak lensing pipeline (coming soon). 

If you are intersted in the old Inspector Gadget Pipeline, please check out the Inspector_Gadget branch after cloning this repository, on which a backup copy has been saved
