Inspector Gadget Pipeline (Version 0.1)
===============

This is a pipeline for Weak Gravitational Lensing simulations: given a set of cosmological parameters, it produces multiple realizations of convergence and shear maps that can then be used for further statistical analysis. The IG pipeline consists of three steps:
 - 3D cosmological box generation using Gadget 2
 - Projection of the 3D simulation boxes on 2D lensing planes
 - Ray tracing and production of 2D convergence and shear maps
